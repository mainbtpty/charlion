    <p>Speech with Charlion uses GPT-style models to generate audio from scratch. Different from Vall-E, the initial text prompt is embedded into high-level semantic tokens without the use of phonemes. It can therefore generalize to arbitrary instructions beyond speech that occur in the training data, such as music lyrics, sound effects, or other non-speech sounds. A subsequent second model is used to convert the generated semantic tokens into audio codec tokens to generate the full waveform.</p>
    <p>Below is a list of some known non-speech sounds, but we are finding more every day. Please let us know if you find patterns that work particularly well:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>[laughter]</li>
      <li>[laughs]</li>
      <li>[sighs]</li>
      <li>[music]</li>
      <li>[gasps]</li>
      <li>[clears throat]</li>
      <li>— or ... for hesitations</li>
      <li>♪ for song lyrics</li>
      <li>Capitalization for emphasis of a word</li>
      <li>MAN/WOMAN: for bias towards speaker</li>
